# Testcase-on-Rapido
# Description:
This document contains a comprehensive set of manual test cases created for testing the functionality, UI, and form validations of the Rapido website, one of India’s leading bike taxi platforms. The goal of this testing effort is to identify bugs, inconsistencies, and areas of improvement related to user experience, navigation, responsiveness, and input validation.

The test cases are structured using standard QA practices and include modules such as UI/Footer, Contact Us form, Cross-Browser Compatibility, and Login/Signup flow. Each test case is written with clear test steps, expected vs. actual results, and a status that highlights whether the test case passed or failed. The document also tracks bug severity to help prioritize fixes.

# Key Testing Areas:

Cross-Browser Compatibility

The website opens in different browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari), but inconsistencies in layout or functionality are observed.

Access Control

Login/Signup is not enforced to access core website features, which may or may not align with the product requirement.

Some internal pages do not include the YouTube icon under the “Follow Us” section in the footer, unlike the homepage.

Responsive Design

On mobile devices, layout and elements overlap or appear misaligned, indicating poor responsiveness.

Broken Links
